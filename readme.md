Program 3: Sending Photos To A Concurrent Photo Server
======================================================

Authors: Daniel Beckwith (djbeckwith), Aditya Nivarthi (anivarthi)

Purpose:
* This program is used to demonstrate sending and receiving photos from a client to a server.
* The client can send photos separated in packets to the server, which saves them as new files.
* The connection protocols between client and server are simulated to demonstrate their function. The OSI Network Layer, Data Link Layer, and Physical Layer are implemented in the application as a simulation.

Compile:
* Use make to compile, which will create team_3_photo_client and team_3_photo_server
